## Commands used in chapter 6

These commands prints out the version of npm and node

```bash
npm -v
node -v
```

If you use npm 5.1 or earlier, you can't use npx. Instead, install create-react-app globally:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```
Now you can run:

```bash 
create-react-app my-app
```

This command creates React app named myapp  in npm 5.1 or later:

```bash
npx create-react-app myapp
```

This command starts React app (execute in the project root folder)

```bash
npm start
```

OR if you are using yarn

```bash
yarn star
```
